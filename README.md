## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps

App: TIMES Magazine
     *Searching the library of different magazines
     *Adjusting size of font
     
App: X (Formerly Twitter)
     *Being able to use bots to enchance experience
     
App: Canvas
     *Seeing mail messages in one of the tabs

Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

App Idea: I would like to create an app that focuses on helping people learning more about their religion. The should have a feature where the user can select which is their objective of their search. Depending on the option the user selects, the app will offer information that challenges the views of their religion or offer information as support. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. **Trying to make the counter for the picture to go back to firstPicture after 10 seconds**
